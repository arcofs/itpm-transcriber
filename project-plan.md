- A set of sample insights extracted from test transcripts.

  

# Sprint 3: Integration with Obsidian Notes (Week 3)

## Goal: Develop a module to output insights as Markdown files in the Obsidian vault.

  

### Tasks:

**Markdown Formatting (Day 1-2)**

- Develop a function to convert insights into well-structured Markdown.

- Ensure proper formatting (headings, bullet points, links).

**File Handling & Creation (Day 3-5)**

- Handle file naming conventions, overwriting, and creating new notes.

**Testing & Error Handling (Day 6-7)**

- Test the integration by creating and updating notes in the Obsidian vault.

- Implement robust error handling for file I/O operations (e.g., permissions, path issues).

**Deliverables:**

- A module that creates or updates Markdown files in the Obsidian vault.

- Tested scripts that integrate insights into Obsidian.

- Error handling for file operations.

  

# Sprint 4: Full Workflow Integration and CLI Interface (Week 4)

## Goal: Integrate all modules into a complete workflow and develop a simple CLI for user interaction.

  

### Tasks:

**Full Workflow Integration (Day 1-3)**

  

- Integrate video extraction, transcript processing, LLM insight generation, and Markdown output into a single workflow.

- Ensure each module interacts seamlessly with the others.

**Command-Line Interface (CLI) Development (Day 4-5)**

  

- Develop a simple CLI to allow users to input a YouTube channel ID or video URL and receive insights.

- Implement options for customizing output (e.g., choose where to save the Markdown file).

**Testing & Debugging (Day 6-7)**

  

- Conduct end-to-end testing with multiple video sources.

- Debug any issues that arise in the integrated workflow.

- Optimize the code for efficiency and error resilience.

**Deliverables:**

- A fully integrated script that extracts insights and outputs them to Obsidian.

- A functional CLI for user interaction.

- Comprehensive testing and debugging documentation.

  

# Sprint 5: Final Refinements, Documentation, and Deployment (Week 5)

## Goal: Refine the application, add documentation, and prepare for deployment.

  

### Tasks:

**Code Refinement (Day 1-2)**

- Review the codebase for modularity, readability, and adherence to best practices.

- Optimize error handling and logging across all modules.

**Documentation (Day 3-4)**

- Create detailed documentation for each module and the overall workflow.

- Include setup instructions, usage guides, and troubleshooting tips.

**Deployment Preparation (Day 5-6)**

- Containerize the application using Docker (if necessary).

- Prepare for deployment or distribution (e.g., package the script for easy installation).

**Final Testing & Launch (Day 7)**

- Conduct final testing on various systems.

- Launch the application and monitor for any post-deployment issues.

**Deliverables:**

- A polished, modular codebase ready for deployment.

- Comprehensive documentation for developers and end-users.

- A containerized application or distribution package.

  

## Post-Development: Maintenance and Feature Enhancements

Goal: Maintain the application, fix bugs, and consider future feature additions.

  

### Tasks:

**Bug Fixes and Maintenance**

- Monitor the application for bugs or issues.

- Release patches or updates as needed.

**Feature Enhancements**

- Gather user feedback for potential features (e.g., GUI, advanced analytics).

- Plan and implement future iterations based on user needs and technological advancements.

**Deliverables:**
